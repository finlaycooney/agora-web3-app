# Reviewed sources and automatic extraction release

This checkpoint keeps extraction running as more pages of an enabled chat's full
history arrive. Recruiters can stop automatic extraction separately from history
import. It also lets them release a reviewed batch's message context once every
linked draft, suggestion and CV operation is resolved.

## Source decisions

The default is to keep source context. A candidate approval does not prove that
the recruiter reviewed unrelated job, client or lead information in the same
batch. “Release after candidate review” explicitly releases that remaining
context; it is safe to request while candidates still need work. The interface
shows what still prevents deletion. Keeping context again cancels a pending
release, but cannot restore a completed purge.

Cleanup removes raw message bodies, source snapshots, resolved proposal quotes
and unused evidence or attachment hints. Reviewed profiles and their CVs remain.
Minimal message identities and result receipts prevent repeated imports or lost
acknowledgements from recreating deleted material. Storage quotas are released
only after the deletion transaction succeeds.

## Hosted maintenance

Deploy migration `20261002190000` and the hosted application together while the
Telegram intake feature remains disabled for broad rollout. Provision a separate
database login with membership in `app_telegram_maintenance`, `NOINHERIT`, and no
other application, owner, administrative or bypass-RLS role. This login can only
execute the bounded maintenance entry point. It cannot choose a recruiter, read
messages, approve candidates or change source decisions.

Set server-only `TELEGRAM_MAINTENANCE_DATABASE_URL` to that login's connection
string. Set `TELEGRAM_MAINTENANCE_SECRET` to a newly generated random 32-byte
base64url token (43 characters). Store credentials through private deployment
secret management; never put them in the repository, a public environment
variable, a URL or a command argument.

Set these repository Actions secrets:

- `TELEGRAM_MAINTENANCE_URL`: the production HTTPS URL ending exactly in
  `/api/telegram-maintenance`, with no query string or embedded credentials.
- `TELEGRAM_MAINTENANCE_SECRET`: the same private maintenance token.

The `Telegram source maintenance` workflow runs every 15 minutes on the default
branch and supports manual dispatch. It needs no npm install, model service,
Telegram session or personal Mac. Each request processes bounded work; each
scheduled run makes at most eight requests and stops early when no work can
progress. The endpoint remains available when the Telegram feature is disabled.
It rejects browser-origin requests, invalid credentials and owner/limit query
parameters, and returns aggregate counts only. Redirects are never followed.

Before enabling intake, manually dispatch the workflow and confirm an
authenticated successful response. An unconfigured workflow prints that no
request was sent; that is not evidence that cleanup is active. Monitor failed
runs and repeated `remainingWork: true` results. A database or network failure
leaves a retryable transaction, not partially decremented quotas. GitHub's
scheduled jobs can be delayed; this is eventual cleanup, not a deletion-time SLA.
Use a more reliable hosted scheduler against the same endpoint if an exact
operational deadline is required.

Searches become unusable at their 15-minute expiry even when maintenance has a
backlog. Physical deletion is separately bounded: up to 100 query text/vector
expirations and 5,000 cached result rows per request. Large result sets can need
multiple passes. Retained source batches with unresolved consumers remain held.

## Release acceptance

Verify catch-up when extraction temporarily empties before the final import page,
enable/disable isolation, the largest legal singleton message, explicit source
release, pending draft/proposal/CV holds, replay after purge, quota accounting and
reimport prevention. Test the maintenance role directly against a disposable
database and test the authenticated hosted endpoint with the intake feature off.

Live Telegram login, provider authentication and real-account acceptance are
separate requirements. This change does not parse CV contents, continuously watch
for newly sent Telegram messages, or erase the original Telegram conversation.
